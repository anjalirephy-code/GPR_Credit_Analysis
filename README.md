#Geopolitical Risk & Consumer Credit Behavior: A Data-Driven Analysis (2015-2025)
This project aims to analyse the correlation between the Geopolitical Risks existing in the world and the Credit Behavior of individuals.
This project investigates the relationship between geopolitical risk and consumer credit behavior over a transformative decade.
Integrated multi-source datasets from the Caldara-Iacoviello Geopolitical Risk Index and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
The project utilized Python's pandas library to clean and merge the datasets, preparing them for deeper analysis. Numpy and matplotlib were then leveraged to visualize the findings,creating time series trends to track changes over the decade, scatter plots to explore correlations, and summary statistics to quantify key patterns in the data.
#Results
The GPR data basically considers wars, terrorism, threats, and military tensions.The FRED data considers the Total consumer credit.
Number of observations = 128 observations.
mean (average) = GPR (Geopolitical Risk Index): 110.24 (average level of geopolitical risk).
                 TOTALSL (Total Consumer Credit): ₹4.23 million (average total sales or credit)
GPR: varies from 58.42 to 318.95.This shows large fluctuations in geopolitical risk over time.
TOTALSL: ranges from 3.32 million to 5.06 million.This shows a gradual growth over time.
The model is statistically significant, meaning geopolitical risk does impact consumer credit behavior.
The relationship is positive, as geopolitical risk rises, consumer credit also increase slightly  due to precautionary borrowing or spending shifts.
Credit Amount steadily rises,meaning credit activity, lending, or investment has been expanding consistently from 2015 to 2026.
GPR fluctuates strongly showing political uncertainty and risk vary over time, with a major spike in 2022.
A sharpe surge in 2022 can be seen in the graphical analysis which corresponds to major global geopolitical events,specifically:
1)Russia–Ukraine war (February 2022), which caused global tensions, supply disruptions, and energy crises.
2)Rising U.S.–China tensions over trade, Taiwan, and technology restrictions.
3)Instability in global markets, reflected in spikes in risk indices worldwide.
This shows that,credit growth was resilient despite geopolitical tensions,possibly due to strong domestic demand, supportive monetary policy, or economic recovery post-COVID.
Financial institutions might have adapted quickly, maintaining lending momentum despite global shocks.
This pattern can be because of a Decoupling effect,where financial or credit activity remains stable even when geopolitical risks surge, especially if central banks or governments step in to stabilize markets.
